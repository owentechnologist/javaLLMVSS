What is PRICE?
Protection, rest, ice, compression, and elevation (PRICE) is a treatment for minor muscle strains, sprains, bruises and other injuries. It is used for the first several days after an injury.

Protection
After an injury, it is important to protect the area from more injury. Depending on where your injury is, you may need to use a sling, splint, crutches, cane, or walking sticks.

Rest
After an injury, you need to take time off from your activities to allow your body to heal. For example, if you sprained your ankle, you may need to avoid walking or putting weight on your ankle. If you were hurt while playing sports, itâ€™s important not to return to play until your injury has healed. Returning to play too early may make the injury worse.

Ice
Ice helps control pain and swelling. Try to put ice on an injury as soon as possible. Put an ice pack, gel pack, or package of frozen vegetables, wrapped in a cloth, on the injured area every 3 to 4 hours for up to 20 minutes at a time. Never put ice directly on the skin.

Compression
Compression helps limit swelling of the injured area. It also gives some additional support to the injured area. You may use an elastic bandage, trainer’s tape, or even a piece of clothing to wrap around the injured area. Be sure not to wrap it too tightly. If itâ€™s too tight, it can cut off the blood supply to the injured area.

Elevation
Raising the injured part of your body up on a pillow is another way to help decrease swelling. It works best if you keep the body part above the level of your heart. This helps to keep fluid from building up in the injured area. If you cannot raise the injured body part above the level of your heart, try to keep it from hanging down by resting it on pillows or a chair.

Let's have a look at the common symptoms associated with medial knee pain and what they typically indicate:

Pain On Inside Of Knee No Swelling: If there is no swelling with your medial knee pain, it is likely only a minor injury such as a small cartilage tear, small bone spurs or a grade 1 MCL sprain.

Inner Knee Pain Running: Knee pain medial side during or after running is most typically caused by a cartilage tear, hamstring tendonitis or Runners Knee.

Inner Knee Pain When Straightening Leg: Pes Anserine Bursitis is the main culprit here as the bursa can easily get squashed when straightening the knee.

Medial Knee Pain With Flexion: Most medial knee pain gets worse with knee flexion, especially when weight bearing through the leg. If it's worse when standing, it may indicate an MCL tear, bone spurs or meniscus tear. If it happens when you are sitting or bending the knee, it may be pes anserine bursitis or plica syndrome.

Anterior Medial Knee Pain: If your inner knee pain is coming round to the front of the knee, it may actually be a problem with the knee cap or Runners Knee rather than one of the structures on the inner knee.

Medial Knee Pain When Sitting Cross Legged: Pain in the inner side of knee when sitting cross legged is most likely due to a meniscus tear as this position places extra stress on the cartilage.

Medial Knee Pain After Sitting or Lying: Inner knee pain that is at its worse when you first move the knee after sitting or lying down for a while tends to be due to knee arthritis. The pain usually eases once you are up and about. In younger patients, it is more likely to be due to Plica Syndrome.

Medial Knee Injuries: The most common medial knee injuries are MCL tears and medial meniscus tears, which often both happen at the same time as a result of awkward twisting or sporting injuries.

Why Is Medial Knee Pain So Common?
Medial knee injuries are really common because muscle weakness and/or tightness, which is very common, can subtly change the way the knee moves.

This causes more force to go through the inner side of the joint, rather than distributing weight evenly through the whole joint, which results in damage to the inner side of the knee and therefore results in medial knee pain. For example, it is much more common to get osteoarthritis on the inner side of the knee than the outer side.

If there is swelling or inflammation alongside your medial knee pain, check out the Swelling On Side Of Knee article.

Just because there is inner knee pain, this does not necessarily mean the problem is on the inner side of the joint. Pain can refer from different places such as the knee cap or even the lower back.

If your inside knee pain does not sound quite like any of these problems, visit the Common Causes of Knee Pain section to find out about the most common knee problems.

There are a huge number of possible causes of knee pain.

It may be that you can pinpoint a specific time when you injured the knee, or it may well be that your symptoms have come on gradually over time with no obvious cause.

Knee pain is a common problem. Symptoms often fluctuate and it can be hard to work out what is wrong. There are so many possible options out there from ligament tears to bursitis, cartilage damage to gout.

Here we are going to focus on common knee conditions - those cases of knee pain where symptoms have come on gradually over time e.g. arthritis, bursitis and tendonitis.

If however your pain started more suddenly due to an injury e.g. from twisting or landing awkwardly, check out the knee injuries guide e.g. ligament sprains, cartilage tears and fractures. If you prefer to think about about where your pain is, visit the knee pain diagnosis section.

Common Causes Of Knee Pain
The most common causes of knee pain from underlying knee conditions are:

1. Runners Knee
Runners Knee is one of the most common causes of knee pain around the front of the knee due to a problem with how the kneecap moves.

Don’t be fooled by the name - it is just as likely to affect those with sedentary lifestyles as it is active people.

Causes: Runners knee usually develops due to a combination of muscle weakness, tightness, flat feet and hip angle

Symptoms: The most common symptoms are kneecap pain, knee swelling and pain on stairs, especially on the way down. Runners Knee usually settles within a few months

Treatment: One of the most effective treatments for Runners Knee is exercises to strengthen and stretch the knee muscles. Other things that can help include ice, knee braces and orthotics. Occasionally surgery is required

2. Iliotibial Band Syndrome aka ITBS
Iliotibial band syndrome is the most common of the causes of knee pain on the outer side of the joint and is often seen in runners. The iliotibial band runs down the outer side of the thigh attaching at the knee.

Iliotibial band syndrome typically causes pain on the outer side of the knee
Causes: Ilitibial band syndrome usually develops due to excessive friction on the IT band, caused by things such as muscle imbalance, excessive running, or running on a slope and incorrect training methods resulting in inflammation

Symptoms: ITBS typically results in pain on the outer side of the knee that gets worse with activities such as running and going down steps. There may be a funny snapping sensation as you bend your knee and some swelling

Treatment: Rest from aggravating activities is important with ITBS and should be combined with tailored strengthening and stretching exercises. Wearing a knee strap can make a big difference along with orthotics, injections and in some cases knee surgery

3. Chondromalacia Patella
Chondromalacia Patella is one of the most common causes of knee problems in sporty adolescents and young adults, especially females.

Causes: Chondromalacia patella is caused by damage to the cartilage that lines the back of the kneecap usually due to a combination of muscle imbalance, altered biomechanics and overuse

Symptoms: It results in pain at the front of the knee, especially when going down stairs, or after sitting for long periods, and can cause the knee to make funny noises when it moves.

Treatment: Exercises, knee straps, medication, shoe insoles and activity modification are the usual treatment options for chondromalacia

4. Osgood Schlatters Disease
Osgood Schlatter Disease is one of the most common causes of knee pain in teenagers, especially males.

Osgood schlatters Disease is one of the most common causes of knee pain in teenagers
Causes: Osgood Schlatters usually develops after a growth spurt due to the bones growing faster than the muscles, causing friction. This can lead to a bony lump forming just below the patella

Symptoms: There is usually pain below the kneecap, worse with activity, better with rest.  Tenderness and swelling over the shin bone are common

Treatment: A combination of PRICE, exercises, knee straps and knee pads usually work well

Recovery: This is one of the longer lasting causes of knee pain and it can take anywhere from a few weeks to 2 years to settle

5. Knee Arthritis
Knee Arthritis is the most common of the causes of knee pain in people over the age of 50.

Causes: Knee Arthritis is caused by wear and tear to the cartilage that lines the joint, leading to bone on bone contact. It is more common in women and in those who have previously injured their knee or had knee surgery

Symptoms: Arthritis in the knee can cause pain, swelling, weakness, limited movement and difficulty with everyday activities such as walking and going up and down stairs. Symptoms of knee arthritis tend to get progressively worse over time

Treatment: Knee Arthritis treatment varies according to the severity of the disease. Common treatments for arthritis include exercises, knee braces, natural remedies, acupuncture, dietary changes, medication and in severe cases surgery

6. Bursitis of the Knee
Knee bursitis is caused by inflammation of a bursa - small fluid-filled sacs that lie between bones and muscles/tendons to prevent irritation. There are approximately 15 bursae around the knee e.g. suprapatellar bursa and infrapatellar bursa. Knee bursitis typically causes pockets of swelling in and around the knee.

Inflammation of one of the knee bursa can cause pain
Causes: Excessive friction from activities such as jumping, running or muscle tightness can lead to swelling of one or more bursa which leads to pain

Symptoms: The location of the pain will depend on which bursa is affected. The symptoms tend to be general pain and swelling around the knee

Treatment: Rest from aggravating activities is vital when bursitis causes knee pain.  A combination of strengthening and stretching exercises usually helps

7. Bakers Cyst
A Bakers Cyst, aka Popliteal Bursitis, is one of the most common causes of knee pain at the back of the knee and is due to inflammation of the popliteal bursa which sits behind the knee joint.

Causes: It is usually caused by fluid associated with arthritis or a cartilage tear leaking into the bursa and causing it to swell, but it can occur after any damage to the knee

Symptoms: The symptoms of a Bakers Cyst knee tend to be pain and swelling behind the knee, like a soft orange which can limit knee movement

Treatment: Treatment options include ice, medication and injections to reduce pain and swelling, and exercises.  In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to drain or remove the knee bursa

8. Housemaids Knee
Again, don’t be fooled by the name. Nowadays, Housemaids Knee, aka Prepatellar Bursitis, usually affects tradesmen such as roofers and carpet layers who spend long periods kneeling who suffer from this common cause of front knee pain and swelling.

Causes: Excessive kneeling, or less commonly, a knock to the front of the knee causes swelling in the prepatellar bursa

Symptoms: The most common symptoms of housemaids knee are pain at the front of the knee, swelling (again like a soft orange) and difficulty walking, bending the knee and kneeling

Treatment: As with other bursitis causes of knee pain a combination of rest, ice, medication, injections and exercises tends to be most effective

9. Pes Anserine Bursitis
Pes Anserine Bursitis is one of the causes of knee pain on the inner side of the knee slightly below the joint, caused by inflammation of the pes anserinus bursa.

Pes Anserine is one of the less common causes of knee pain.  It causes pain on the inner side of the knee, below the joint
Causes: Repetitive friction from activities such as swimming and running irritates the pes anserine knee bursa. People with other medical conditions such as arthritis and type 2 diabetes, along with obese middle-aged women are the most likely to be affected

Symptoms: Pain in the inner side of the knee 2-3 inches below the joint in the most defining symptom of pes anserine bursitis. Sleep is often disturbed and there may be weakness and stiffness in the knee

Treatment: As with most causes of knee pain, exercises are one of the most important treatment options here. They should be used carefully to allow rest from any aggravating activities. Medication and steroid injections can also help

10. Gout Knee
Gout Knee is a type of arthritis and is one if the causes of knee pain that can affect other areas as well such as the hands and feet.  High levels of urate crystals form in the joint causing intense knee pain and inflammation.

Causes: Common causes of gout include diet, obesity, genetics, medical conditions such as diabetes and knee injuries

Symptoms: Gout sufferers typically present with a hot, swollen, red knee which usually develop at night and can be extremely painful

Treatment: Medication is one of the best treatments for inflammatory causes of knee pain and gout is no exception.  Rest and ice can also help

11. Jumpers Knee
Jumpers Knee, aka Patellar Tendonitis, is one of the common causes of knee pain affecting sports players caused by damage to the tendon just below the kneecap.

Patellar Tendonitis is one of the common causes of knee pain below the kneecap
Causes: Repetitive jumping and/or kicking can lead to Jumpers Knee as these activities place lots of strain on the patellar tendon and can lead to small tears in the tendon. This weakens the tendon and makes it prone to further damage

Symptoms: The most common symptoms of patellar tendonitis include pain just below the kneecap, especially after prolonged periods of rest and/or activity as well as knee stiffness first thing in the morning

Treatment: Rest from any activities that are causes of knee pain here, exercises and in some cases surgery.  Many people find wearing a knee strap really helps as it takes the tension off the patella tendon

12. Quadriceps Tendonitis
Quadriceps Tendonitis is a common cause of activity-related pain at the front of the knee.

Causes: Sports involving lots of jumping, sprinting or quick turns, over-training and muscle imbalance place excess force through the tendon above the kneecap, resulting in small tears

Symptoms: Pain just above the kneecap that gets worse with activity, knee swelling and stiffness and kneecap tenderness

Treatment: Rest from aggravating activities, knee strap, strengthening & stretching exercises, ice, friction massage, injections and knee surgery

13. Hamstring Tendonitis
A common cause of knee pain in the back of the leg is hamstring tendonitis.

Causes: Repetitive activities such as jumping, kicking, running and quick pivoting movements leads to inflammation and degeneration of the tendons of the hamstring muscles

Symptoms: dull, aching pain behind the knee that gets worse with activity and better with rest. May cause localised swelling behind the knee as well as restricting knee movement due to stiffness and weakness

Treatment: PRICE, medications, strengthening and stretching exercises, knee straps and physical therapy

14. Osteochondritis Dissecans
Osetochondritis Dissecans is one of the less common causes of knee pain. A reduced blood supply to parts of the bone causes loose fragments of cartilage and bone to break off. Whilst it can occur in any joint, it is the knee that is the most commonly affected.

Causes: Repetitive minor damage to the joint from activities such as jumping and kicking can lead to osteochondritis at the knee.  There is also thought to be a genetic link

Symptoms: As well as knee pain, it can cause locking and clunking sensations in the knee, limited movement and swelling

Treatment: Non-surgical treatment including rest, physical therapy and the use of knee braces. In some cases surgery is necessary

15. Bipartite Patella
Bipartite patella is a knee condition that often goes unnoticed until you overwork or injure the knee making it one of the more rare causes of knee pain.

Causes: Incomplete formation of the kneecap - the bone fails to fuse together fully during childhood leaving the kneecap in two pieces

Symptoms: Pain at the front of the knee, tender to touch, feels like the knee will give way and you may be able to feel a slight ridge on the kneecap. Many people with bipartite patella go through life never knowing they have it as it often doesn't cause any pain at all

Treatment: Rest from aggravating activities, strengthening and stretching exercises, knee braces and occasionally surgery to join the bony fragments

Recovery: Symptoms of bipartite patella usually settle within two to three months

16. Plica Syndrome
Plica syndrome is a cause of knee pain that often goes undiagnosed as it's symptoms mimic other knee problems. It is caused by inflammation of the membrane that lines the knee joint.

Causes: Blow to the front of the knee, repetitive knee bending e.g. cycling or stairs, sudden increase in activity levels, knee injury and muscle weakness

Symptoms: Dull, achy knee pain that gets worse with activity, instability, knee clicking, locked knee, restricted movement

Treatment: Rest from aggravating activities, stretches, strengthening exercises, physical therapy, steroid injections or surgery

17. Knee Bone Spurs
knee bone spurs are common causes of knee pain and stiffness, particularly in the over-60s. Irritation and damage of the knee cartilage causes the body to lay down excess bone as a preventative measure which leads to excess lumps of bone forming, known as osteophytes.

Causes: knee cartilage damage from arthritis, meniscus tears, knee injuries, aging, repetitive stress, muscle tightness, obesity & genetics

Symptoms: Sharp, catching knee pain that is worse when you move the knee or weight-bear, knee swelling, joint stiffness, clicking/locking sensations, numbness/tingling, hard lump

Treatment: medication, physical therapy, exercises, joint mobilisations, knee injections, orthotics, lifestyle modifications, surgery
